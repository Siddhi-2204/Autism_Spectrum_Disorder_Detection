# 🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection using Machine Learning  

This project investigates the use of **Machine Learning (ML)** models to detect **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** based on behavioral screening data.  
We apply **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification and compare their performance.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of real-world screening dataset (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)  
- Implementation of **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** models  
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity  
- Comparison of ML models → **SVM achieved 100% accuracy** vs **99% for Logistic Regression**
